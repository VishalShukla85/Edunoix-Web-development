                C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
                It is a very popular language, despite being old. C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.<br>

                    Why Learn C?

                    <li>It is one of the most popular programming language in the world</li>
                    <li>If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar</li>
                    <li>C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python</li>
                    <li>C is a Middle-Level Language</li>
                    <li>Helps to understand the fundamentals of Computer Theories</li>
                    <li>C is very fast in terms of execution time.</li>
                    <li>Fewer Libraries</li>

                    Difference between C and C++
                </h1>
                <p class="section-paragraph">The most important point of difference between C vs C++ is that, C is based on procedural oriented programing 
                    and C++ is based on object oriented programing method. Letâ€™s understand this in detail.</p><br>
                <ul class="sections-list">
                    <li>C was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories while C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup of Bell Laboratories in the early 1980s.</li>
                    <li>C has 32 keywords while C++ has 63 keywords.</li>
                    <li>Supports built-in data types while Supports both built-in and user-defined data types.</li>
                    <li>The file extension of a program in C language is .c while The file extension of a C++ program is .cpp.</li>
                    <li>C uses scanf() and printf() functions for input/output while C++ uses cin and cout for input/output.</li>
